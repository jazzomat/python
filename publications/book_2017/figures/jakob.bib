legato and glissando for guitarThis publications focusses on two types of expression styles performed on the classical guitar, the legato technique which corresponds to the hammer-on and pull-off technique and the glissando technique which corresponds to slides .\\
- both techniques result in an ascending or descending after the note was initially plucked\\
- the High Frequency Content (HFC) measure was used to detect the pluck onset with its percussive characteristics\\
- between note onsets, the YIN fundamental frequency estimation algorithm was used to characterize the pitch progression and the complex domain algorithm was used to detect regions of aperiodicity. \\
- each note's release part was compressed / enlarged in time to apply a unified segmentation into 5 segments\\
 - for both amplitude and aperiodicity, two histogram-based models for each expression style was learned based on training samples and the classification of the expression style of unknown samples was performed based on distance measures towards these models
- the pitch progression was furthermore analyzed to classify ascending and descending legati / glissandi\\
- experiment results with small dataset of 72 note (transitions),

GENERAL
- identify left-hand articulations for guitar playing
- 
        
APPROACH
- "articulations" = note transitions
  - legator (= HO / PU)
  - appoggiatura ( = Slides)
- combining different onset detection algorithms
- (used Aubio library)
        
1) Plucking detection
  - High Frequency Content measure (HFC) -> good to detect percussive onsets, bad for non-percussive / harmonic onsets
  - manual threshold adjustments
        
2) Envelope investigation
  - attack part end -> 10ms after amplitude maximum
  - release point -> amplitude = 3% of local max
        
3) Pitch detection
  - YIN
  - Complex Domain algorithm to detect pitch changes within notes + chroma filtering to avoid false-positive in noisy attack phase
    -> 
        
4) Distinguish between both playing styles
  - duration of first sub-segment before pitch change
  - 
        
LIMITATIONS
        
        
DATASET
EVALUATION
  - evaluated upwards / downwards application of the techniques
  - evaluated metallic / non-metallic strings
        
        
RESULTS
  - legatos are easier to detect than appoggiaturas

@article{Aucouturier2007,
abstract = {The "bag-of-frames" approach (BOF) to audio pattern recognition represents
signals as the long-term statistical distribution of their local
spectral features. This approach has proved nearly optimal for simulating
the auditory perception of natural and human environments (or soundscapes),
and is also the most predominent paradigm to extract high-level descriptions
from music signals. However, recent studies show that, contrary to
its application to soundscape signals, BOF only provides limited
performance when applied to polyphonic music signals. This paper
proposes to explicitly examine the difference between urban soundscapes
and polyphonic music with respect to their modeling with the BOF
approach. First, the application of the same measure of acoustic
similarity on both soundscape and music data sets confirms that the
BOF approach can model soundscapes to near-perfect precision, and
exhibits none of the limitations observed in the music data set.
Second, the modification of this measure by two custom homogeneity
transforms reveals critical differences in the temporal and statistical
structure of the typical frame distribution of each type of signal.
Such differences may explain the uneven performance of BOF algorithms
on soundscapes and music signals, and suggest that their human perception
rely on cognitive processes of a different nature.},

abstract = {Playing string instruments implies motor skills including asymmetrical interlimb coordination. How special is musical skill as compared to other bimanually coordinated, non-musical skillful performances? We succeeded for the first time to measure quantitatively bimanual coordination in violinists playing repeatedly a simple tone sequence. A motion analysis system was used to record finger and bow trajectories for assessing the temporal structure of finger-press, finger-lift (left hand), and bow stroke reversals (right arm). The main results were: (1) fingering consisted of serial and parallel (anticipatory) mechanisms; (2) synchronization between finger and bow actions varied from -12 ms to 60 ms, but these 'errors' were not perceived. The results suggest that (1) bow-finger synchronization varied by about 50 ms from perfect simultaneity, but without impairing auditory perception; (2) the temporal structure depends on a number of combinatorial mechanisms of bowing and fingering. These basic mechanisms were observed in all players, including all amateurs. The successful biomechanical measures of fingering and bowing open a vast practical field of assessing motor skills. Thus, objective assessment of larger groups of string players with varying musical proficiency, or of professional string players developing movement disorders, may be helpful in music education.},

- transitions between different hidden states / fingerings are constrained by
  - musicological model (trained with chord sequence database)
  - model of physical difficulty of different chord changes
        
- multipitch estimation based on Klapuri's spectral summation

GENERAL
- transcription system for violin ("expressiveness transcription")
  - score parameters (pitch, onset, duration) & playing techniques
- taxonomy consists of 8 violin playing techniques
  - shared techniques with this thesis (vibrato, flageolett-t\"{o}ne = harmonics, pizzicato = finger-style)
        
APPROACH
1. Feature extraction
1.1. time-domain 
  - LP to get signal envelope -> apply envelope model to compute attack, sustain, and release time
1.2. frequency domain
  - FFT + frequency warping to log-f scale (violin range G3-C8)
1.2.a. pitch extraction
  - thresholding of MIDI spectrum, peak-picking + heuristic based on expected intervals between harmonics on a log-f scale with 12 bins/oct
  - bandwidth around largest peak = spectral width (feature)
2. Playing technique estimation
  - no classification approach (Machine learning like) but rule-based decision tree with empirically found thresholds for different features ("expressive decision flowchart")
        
LIMITATIONS
- vibrato was not detected via f(t) analysis !

GENERAL
- method for estimation of the played string from isolated guitar notes
- 
        
APPROACH
- time-domain envelopy detection
- non-parametric spectral estimation (STFT)
- features (generally timbre-motivated)
  - spectral centroid
  - f0-adjusted SC, non-harmonic SC (with harmonic peaks removed)
  - relative amplitudes of first 4 harmonics
  - temporal evolution of partial frequencies over time (tau from exp. decaying function)
  - inharmonicity coefficient
- LDA + GMM for classification
LIMITATIONS
- in order to compute temporal features -> one frame is note sufficient but the whole note needs to be analyzed
- (only first 4 harmonics analzed for their amplitudes)
        
        
DATASET
- variation in 
  - classical & acoustic guitar (nylon & steel strings)
  - playing techniques
  - dynamics
        
EVALUATION
- manually selected three best performing features ( 
        
RESULTS
- diverse results
  - different amount of overlap between string class samples (notes) for different pitch values
- no overall performance measure
- high sensitivity of the results towards the compilation of the training data

waveguides allow the efficient synthesis of harmonically spaced

components for a fixed number of arithmetic operations. They

are thus well suited to audio synthesis based on one-dimensional

physical models (such as strings or tubes) that possess nearly harmonic

spectra. In higher dimensions, however, modal frequencies

do not fall in harmonic series. In this letter, we show how digital

waveguide structures may be extracted from higher dimensional

problems, yielding algorithms more efficient than modal synthesis,

with reference to the solution of the two-dimensional wave equation

defined over a square region. Numerical results are presented.},

- analysis and trans-synthesis of acoustic bowed string instruments
        
MOTIVATION
- authors state that in general, the "adequate number of templates" will be unpredictable if musical notes are played with different instruments & playing techniques / expressive gestures
        
APPROACH
- NMF-based analysis
  - authors claim that multiple templates per note are necessary to capture time-varying timbre characteristics of certain instruments
  - "iterative pro- cedure for deciding the appropriate number of templates is pro- posed for NMF. No trained tone model is required in advance."
        
- NMF-parameters are fed in to a sinosoidal synthesis model
 - Spectral modeling synthesis (SMS): signal is modeled as sum of deterministic and stochastic part & additional transient modeling

abstract = {This thesis consists of an introduction and nine articles. The general
framework of the articles is the analysis and synthesis 

of plucked string instruments. The articles document acoustical analysis
and model-based sound synthesis of the tanbur, 

the kantele, the lute, and the ud that are all traditional or historical
plucked string instruments. In addition, the author's 

contributions to the development of an integrated model-based plucked
string synthesis system is presented. As a key 

study, the integrated system concentrates on model-based sound synthesis
of the acoustic guitar. However, the sound 

synthesis models of other plucked string instruments are also implemented
within the system. Finally, two alternative 

techniques that can be used in model-based sound synthesis are covered.
The first technique focuses on the loop filter 

design based on a polynomial damping model. The second technique presents
a synthesis model based on finite 

differences that can be used in real-time sound synthesis.},

    - spectral subtraction a sinosoidal model
- important for natural instrument sounds
  - attack transients
  - note transitions
  - plucking process (string-finger-interaction)
-  
        
        
APPROACH
- fourth-order Lagrange interpolator to allow fine-tuning of delay (for vibrato etc)
- model parameters to be estimated
  - loop delay (integer and fractional part)
  - excitation signal
  - loop filter parameters (influence damping)
- f_0 estimation with autocorrelation method + pitch-synchronous FT
  - amplitude, freq, and phase trajectories are estimated via peak picking
  -> estimation of the partial decay rates
-> synthesize a deterministic (sinosoidal) signal and perform time-domain subtraction -> residual / excitation signal)
- optimization routine for automatic fine-tuning
- 
        
        
LIMITATIONS
- excitation signal esitmation problematic for higher SNRs

GENERAL
        
- instrument construction and knowledge about tuning and pitch ranges can be used to constrain the transcription process
- "The development of a musician’s intuition for the cause-effect relationship inherent in producing sound is essential to mastering the instrument."
        
APPROACH
        
- real-time guitar transcription
- fs = 8000Hz (highest guitar f0: 1174Hz, D6 at fret 22)
  - compromise between demands to performance and to resolving the first harmonics of the highest notes without any alias
- authors apply a polyphonic pitch detection algorithm, results are scored based on knowledge about the guitar
  - maximum polyphony = 6
  - maximum stretch span of gripping hand (maximum number of unique frets in a chord = 4)
- STFT, partially overlapping Hann window, 
- fs = 8000, N = 2048, DeltaF = 3.91 Hz, t_window = .256 Hz
 ( for real time applications: maximum allowed latency needs to be considered)
- quadratic curve fitting is applied to extrapolate values between frequency bin positions
- use "PeakDet" peak detection algorithm
        
- criteria to evaluate peaks as definite fundamentals:
  - must be a power-of-two multiple of a possible f_0,
  - must have supporting harmonics
  - can note be explained as a harmonic of a previously established definite fundamental
        
- different combinations of f_0 candidates and assigned string numbers -> "guitar states"
- guitar states are evaluated based on three metrics
   - "Support" -> number of supporting harmonics
   - "Power" -> amplitude sum of harmonic 0 & 1
      - is set into relationship with mean power of all definitive fundamentals
   - "Spread" -> fingering confidence, "biomechnic feasibility"
        
RESULTS:
        
- tested with different common chord shapes

abstract = {A virtual string has been designed with the association of a sensor, a real-time algorithm and a mechanical actuator. The force exerted by a real bow on a small surface is measured, the velocity that a real string would exhibit under this excitation is computed by a fast DSP-board and the corresponding motion is generated by the actuator at the bowed surface. Corrections are needed for taking into account the characteristics of these various elements. They are achieved by means of IIR filters designed with LMS optimizations. One finally observes the classical Helmholtz motion of the bowed string, although some stability problems may still to be overcome},

abstract = {This work involves the analysis of musical instrument sounds, the creation of timbre models, the estimation of the parameters of the timbre models and the analysis of the timbre model parameters. The timbre models are found by studying the literature of auditory perception, and by studying the gestures of music performance. Some of the important results from this work are an improved fundamental frequency estimator, a new envelope analysis method, and simple intuitive models for the sound of musical instruments. Furthermore a model for the spectral envelope is introduced in this work. A new function, the brightness creation function, is introduced in the spectral envelope model. The timbre model is used to analyze the evolution of the different timbre parameters when the fundamental frequency is changed, but also for different intensity, tempo, or style. The main results from this analysis are that brightness rises with frequency, but nevertheless the fundamental has almost all amplitude for the high notes. The attack and release times generally fall with frequency. It was found that only brightness and amplitude are affected by a change in intensity, and only the sustain and release times are affected when the tempo is changed. The different timbre models are also used for the classification of the sounds in musical instrument classes with very good results. Finally, listening tests have been performed, which assessed that the best timbre model has an acceptable sound quality.},

GENERAL
- virtual instrument for guitar (el., ac.) synthesis in combination with position-sensing and motion-sensing hand-controllers + additional guitar fx
        
APPROACH
- systen 
  - sensors -> gesture recognition
    - diff. approaches -> hand-held sensors sticks, hand motion tracking (video, MoCap), acoustic positioning measure by delay time of sound propagation between both hands)
  - interface for mapping sensor data to expressive parameters of synthesis model
  - (additional AI model allows to interpret musical context / trigger musical phrases such as slide note transition) 
  - synthesiss
        
- hand-held sensors  - left-hgand sensors by motional capture / video tracking
  - right-hand : accelarator sensors to capture plucking movement
- timbre can be varied by changing the plucking point, plucking force, damping amount
- parameter estimation
  - initial param estimation to calibrate the model
  - later param estimation for playing technique ( gesture reco
        - separate string calibration (fixed plucking point , different loudness)
  - for each string / each fingering (fret) -> decay time constants of the 10-20 lowest partials are investigated using curve fitting (lin. on dB scale)
  - "excitation wavetable" contains excitation functions that corresponds to different plucking styles (obtained by inverse filtering real note recordings with the synthesis model)

GENERAL
        
- string detection for bowed string sounds
- combining audio-based estimation & context-dependent error correction
- electric violin (2 types of strings) + acoustic violin
- huge timbral variety can be nullified by having various bow strokes in the training dataset
- estimation algorithm is robust against
  - instruments
  - brand of strings
- using heuristics to avoid unmusical errors
        
MOTIVATION
- string detection to be used for fingering analysis
- stylistic analysis of musicians / uncovering personal taste for different fingerings / timbres
        
        
APPROACH
- audio-2-score alignment
- feature extraction
 - filterbank-energy values (like relative harmonic amplitudes but without harmonic detection / peak picking
- feature averaging & normalizing
- GMM for feature modeling
- model adaptation to "environment" (violin, used strings)
  - cluster-wise feature normalization
  - (-) assumption that different environments are complete captured by normalizing feature mean values
- context-dependent error correction
  - empirically observed rules for string choice of musicians dependent of the given score
  - 
        
LIMITATIONS
        
        
DATASET
- monophonic violin recordings (Brahms, Mendelsohn)
- 
EVALUATION
        
RESULTS
- both context-dependent error correction and model adaptation lead to improved results in different scenarios (same violin, same strings & SV DS, DV DS)

@article{Nadovich:2008:AESM,
abstract = {Synthetic Instrument 's are software entities, but there has been
little dedicated support for them in available software tools. The
focus has been exclusively on other areas, such as visual data flow
and signal processing, but not on simplifying and automating instrument
synthesis

itself. A sad consequence of this mismatch between the tools available
and the requirements of Synthetic Instrument design is that test
engineers often are faced with considerable software challenge should
they choose to apply a synthetic instrument rather than a natural
instrument.

But there's no inherent reason why this mismatch and consequent challenge
should exist. We claim that given the proper tools, the tasks of
specifying, synthesizing, operating, and maintaining synthetic instruments
are simpler than the same tasks performed with natural

instruments. In an attempt to close this gap and thereby prove our

above assertion; we have developed a comprehensive

software environment focused specifically on synthetic

instrument technology. This new system fully synthesizes

instruments and it does so automatically. Every aspect of

the instrument is synthesized: the User Interfaces, the

upward Automated Test Equipment drivers, the data

persistence in riles or databases, the calibration strategy,

the visualization, and, of course, the measurement itself.

Using this new architecture, we can synthesize, simulate,

and implement instruments, automatically without end

user coding.

In addition, the environment provides a fundamentally

robust approach to measurement re-use, as well as a way

to predict performance of synthesized instruments, or to

automatically synthesize instruments that meet particular

desired specifications. Our system is based on

measurement descriptions, not imperative procedures or

data flow graphs. The test engineer specifies what is to be

measured and the system "places" that measurement

optimally on the hardware. In this way, the problem of

legacy measurement hardware is avoided.},

abstract = {This thesis explores acoustical properties of plucked stringed instruments and proposes sound synthesis methods for plucked stringed instruments. In this thesis the investigations of the kantele, the acoustic guitar, the harpsichord, and the guqin provide analysis results, a control algorithm, and two model-based sound synthesis methods in the following way. For a modified design of the kantele, acoustical measurements and formal listening tests support the assumption of increased loudness. The investigation also provides design rules to make a plucked stringed instrument louder. An automatic plucking-point estimation algorithm is proposed for acoustic guitars with an under-saddle pickup. The automatic plucking-point estimation can be used for controlling synthesis algorithms or sound effects. Model-based sound synthesis algorithms are proposed for the harpsichord and the guqin. It was found that the harpsichord exhibits dynamic behavior, albeit limited, when the tangent is pressed down with different speeds. Moreover, the string vibrations and the body response show changes according to the playing level. Hence, the proposed synthesis algorithm is dynamic. The analysis of the guqin reveals the existence of phantom partials in the tones, differences in tones according to the termination technique, and extensive use of flageolet tones and sliding of tones. The model-based sound synthesis algorithm takes these features into account.},

abstract = {The digital synthesis of musical sounds is a field with

many applications in digital audio, computer music, and virtual

environments. One family of sound synthesis methods is physical

modeling, which is based on digital implementations of vibrating

bodies. The physical model is expressed by partial differential

equations which describe the dynamic behavior of strings, membranes,

plates, and other resonators. Various methods can be

used to convert a partial differential equation into a discretetime

model. The so-called functional transformation method

expands the differential operators into their eigenfunctions and

expresses the effect of each eigenfunction by a simple digital

model. The numerical expense grows linearly with the number

of considered eigenfunctions and can be quite large for 2D

or 3D vibrating bodies. This contribution describes a method

to reduce the number of basic digital models by considering

only a representative subset of eigenfunctions. The selection

of the eigenfunctions is based on the well-known concept of

critical bands. Audio examples show that the number of relevant

eigenfunctions can be considerably reduced without impairing

the timbral quality of the synthesized sounds.},

\paragraph*{\cite{Ryynaenen:2008:CMJ}, \cite{Ryynaenen:2007:ICASSP}}
% ------------
Rynn{\"a}nen and Klapuri presented a hybrid transcription framework for bass and melody transcription in polyphonic music in \cite{Ryynaenen:2008:CMJ, Ryynaenen:2007:ICASSP}. 
The note transcription is based on a combination of an acoustical modelling of single note events and a musicological model to use knowledge of the musical context such as the key to derive transition probabilities between certain note pitch values.
Finally, Viterbi decoding is applied to retrieve the bass transcription, which here is the optimal sequence of bass notes and intermediate rests.
        
In order to train the acoustic models, two acoustic features are computed; the \textit{pitch saliency} that expresses the likelihood of a given note pitch at a given time and an \textit{accent signal} that captures the amount of ``spectral novelty'' at a given time instant.
        
Pitch saliency values are computed for MIDI pitch values between 26 (D1 - 36.7Hz) and 59 (B3 - 246.9Hz).
A multiple-f0 estimation algorithm as introduced in \cite{Klapuri:2006:ISMIR} is applied to analyze time frames with a frame size of 92.9ms and a hop size of 23.2ms.
This procedure first uses a spectral whitening to suppress timbral characteristics of the applied bass instrument such as its characteristic harmonic envelope. 
The saliency of potential f0 values is computed by summing up the spectral energy at the corresponding harmonic frequencies. 
To compute the accent signal, the spectrum is subdivided into frequency bands motivated by the perceptual critical bands.
The power differences between adjacent frames are computed band-wise and positive slopes are then summed up over all bands to obtain the accent signal for each frame \cite{Klapuri:2006:TASLP}.
        
To model the temporal progression of single notes, three-state left-to-right Hidden Markov Models (HMM) are trained. 
The three states relate to the commonly used note envelope parts attack, decay, and sustain.
The authors propose to use three models, the target-notes model for the bass and the melody notes, the other-notes model for note events caused by other instruments such as the drums (?), and a noise-or-silence model to model the time frames between sounding notes.

  abstract =  {In this study we compare the use of different music representations for retrieving alternative performances of the same musical piece, a task commonly referred to as version identification. Given the audio signal of a song, we compute descriptors representing its melody, bass line and harmonic progression using state-of-the-art algorithms. These descriptors are then employed to retrieve different versions of the same musical piece using a dynamic programming algorithm based on nonlinear time series analysis. First, we evaluate the accuracy obtained using individual descriptors, and then we examine whether performance can be improved by combining these music representations (i.e.~descriptor fusion). Our results show that whilst harmony is the most reliable music representation for version identification, the melody and bass line representations also carry useful information for this task. Furthermore, we show that by combining these tonal representations we can increase version detection accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate how the proposed version identification method can be adapted for the task of query-by-humming. We propose a melody-based retrieval approach, and demonstrate how melody representations extracted from recordings of a cappella singing can be successfully used to retrieve the original song from a collection of polyphonic audio. The current limitations of the proposed approach are discussed in the context of version identification and query-by-humming, and possible solutions and future research directions are proposed.},

synthesis have attracted much attention recently.

They make use of a variety of sound snippets in a database

to assemble a desired sound or phrase according

to a target specification given in sound descriptors or

by an example sound. With ever-larger sound databases easily

available, together with a pertinent description of their contents,

they are increasingly used for composition, high-level instrument

synthesis, and interactive exploration of a sound corpus. This article

gives an overview of the components needed for corpus-based

concatenative synthesis and details of some realizations. Signal

processing methods are crucial for all parts of analysis, (segmentation

and descriptor analysis), for synthesis, and can intervene in

the selection part, e.g., for spectral matching.},

abstract = {A new approach is proposed that closely synthesizes tones of plucked string instruments by using a class of physical modeling recurrent networks. The strategies employed consist of a fast training algorithm and a multistage training procedure that are able to obtain the synthesis parameters for a specific instrument automatically. The training vector can be recorded tones of most target plucked instruments with ordinary microphones. The proposed approach delivers encouraging results when it is applied to different types of plucked string instruments such as steel-string guitar, nylon-string guitar, harp, Chin, Yueh-chin, and Pipa. The synthesized tones sound very close to the originals produced by their acoustic counterparts. In addition, the paper presents an embedded technique that can produce special effects such as vibrato and portamento that are vital to the playing of plucked-string instruments. The computation required in the resynthesis processing is also reasonable.},

annote = {The melody instrument is considered to be prominent in the middle and high frequency ranges, the bass instrument in the low frequency ranges, respectively.
The algorithm consists of three steps: First, the instrument is identified by computing MFCC as features and computing an LDA-based distance to known feature vectors in a given tone database. 
This database comprises the instruments piano, guitar, violin, cello, trumpet, and trombone.
In order to estimate the melody pitches, the seven highest peaks in the spectrum are computed as features and the melody transcription is performed by retrieving the most similar feature vectors in a pitch database (according to the previously estimated instrument).
The authors apply spectral subtraction in order to remove the spectral energy of the melody instrument.
Finally, the bass line is transcribed by again applying the same instrument recognition and pitch detection steps as before to the residual spectrum.
        
The evaluation was only performed with re-synthesized version of two different MIDI pieces were re-synthesized 
Then, 
        
In order to identify the instrument, low-order MFCC with a non-unified weighting function are computed to describe the spectral envelope. 
The MFCC are averaged over multiple adjacent time frames. },
